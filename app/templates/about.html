     <h1>About the Book</h1>
     <p>Nicole Pradas is a wonderfully weird human being and prefers the company
     of similarly-curious characters. It's not uncommon for one of these weirdos––
     often Nicole herself–– to say something crazy enough to make a stranger's
     head turn.</p>
     <p> The difference between Nicole and a typical goofball is that she
     will write those odd phrases down, often without context, into what she
     affectionately refers to as "The Quotebook". For well over a decade,
     Nicole's Quote Book has collected funny and strange snapshots of her
     daily life and the lives of her friends.</p>

     <p> This website is gift to honor that wierdo. Inside, you will find
     a collection of random snipits of conversations dating all the way back to
     2010. Some are hilarious, some are serious, and some are just plain strange.
     All of them are treasured here and available for a select few friends &
     family to enjoy and reminisce over. </p>

     <h1> How to View The Book</h1>
     <h3>Step 1: Signup for a profile.</h3>
      <p>Follow the menu to the "signup" page and there you can fill out a new
        user profile with a username and password.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Await Approval</h3>
      <p>One of the Quotebook administrators will review your credentials and,
         if you are deemed worthy, will verify your username to allow you access
         to the rest of the site.</p>
      <p> Once you are verified, you will have access to all the quotes in the
        book and can even start submitting quotes as well! Administrators have
        the ability to delete unwanted quotes at will, so make sure it's cool with
        Nicole. This is her baby after all.</p>

      <h2>About the Developer</h2>

      <p> Will Johnson is one of the many weirdos featured in the Quotebook.
       He works as a Python Developer during the day and enjoys making music
       and woodworking in his spare time. In 2020, he wanted to make something
       special for his amazing friend Nicole while also learning more about
       web-development, so he built this site. He's one of the administrators
       for this site as well.</p>

         Quotebook project repository on his github page. </a>
